          <p>
            Once upon a time, in a land where cookies were as big as houses and sprinkles were like
            stars, lived a cookie named Cookie. Now, Cookie wasn\'t just any cookie; he was a Smart
            Cookie. He knew all the numbers, could solve riddles quicker than a rabbit, and could
            even tell you the capital of Antarctica (it's a secret!). But Cookie had a secret too.
            He didn\'t think he was very smart. He was always comparing himself to the other
            cookies, like the Chocolate Chip Cookie, who was always so calm and collected, or the
            Gingerbread Cookie, who could make the most delicious gingerbread houses. Cookie felt
            like he wasn't good enough. One day, the Cookie King announced a big competition. The
            winner would get a golden cookie crown, a prize everyone desired. Cookie wanted to win,
            but his self-doubt held him back. He thought, “What if I don’t win? Everyone will laugh
            at me!” His friend, a kind and wise Oatmeal Cookie, saw Cookie&apos;s struggle. “Why
            don’t you try, Cookie?” she said. “You have a brilliant mind. Just be yourself!” Cookie
            took a deep breath and decided to give it a try. He went to the competition and faced
            many challenges, like solving puzzles, reciting poems, and even baking a delicious
            cookie creation. Each challenge tested his skills and knowledge. To his surprise, Cookie
            excelled! He solved puzzles with ease, recited poems with passion, and baked a
            masterpiece cookie that had everyone drooling. He was having so much fun that he forgot
            all about his self-doubt. When the results were announced, guess who won? Yes, it was
            Cookie! He was crowned the Smartest Cookie in the land. As he wore the golden cookie
            crown, he felt a surge of pride and confidence. From that day on, Cookie never doubted
            himself again. He learned that being smart wasn\'t just about knowing things, but also
            about believing in yourself and embracing your unique talents. He shared his story with
            all the cookies, reminding them that everyone is special in their own way and that
            comparing themselves to others only hinders their growth.
